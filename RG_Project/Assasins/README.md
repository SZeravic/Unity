That is acomplished by controling your "Assasin" or "Hitman" figure on the board and either evading the guards from spoting you or dettecting you.
Complete the levels by any means necessary, you can defeat all the emenies on the board by moving over them when they're not able to see you or
avoid them all together, to beat the level simply try to reach the final destination alive.
